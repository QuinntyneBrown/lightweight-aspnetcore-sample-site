In the past, a [bunch of us](https://github.com/orgs/WebApiContrib/people) from the ASP.NET Web API community worked together on a WebApiContrib project (or really, *projects*, cause there were many of them!).

The idea was to provide an easy to use platform, a one stop place for community contributions for ASP.NET Web API - both larger add ons, such as HTML/Razor support for Web API, as well as smaller things like i.e. reusable filters or even helper methods. This worked extremely well - [WebApiContrib packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Tags%3A"WebApiContrib") were downloaded over 500k times on Nuget, and a nice community has emerged around the project on [Github](https://github.com/WebApiContrib).

Recently, we decided to restart the project, this time focusing on ASP.NET Core. Since the "brand" has caught on in the community and is fairly recognizable, we just called it [WebApiContrib.Core](https://github.com/WebApiContrib/WebAPIContrib.Core).

<!--more-->
There is already a bunch of things there:

- Main package containing i.e. *GlobalRoutePrefixConvention*, *FromBodyApplicationModelConvention* or *OverridableFilterProvider*
- BSON formatter
- CSV formatter
- JSONP formatter
- PlainText formatter
- Markdown tag helper
- WebPages functionality (Razor pages without controllers!)
- Confitional requests support based on RFC-7232

And it's growing quickly. There are several packages pushed to Nuget already too.

It would be wonderful if you would like to particpiate in this community effort - I am sure alomst everyone working on ASP.NET Core would have something interesting to contribute.

If you would like to join the conversation, you can use [this link](https://webapicontrib.azurewebsites.net) to join the slack channel. The repo is [located here on Github](https://github.com/WebApiContrib/WebAPIContrib.Core).

Thanks!
